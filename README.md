#### Application Logs
If you encounter any problems with any of my apps in the repo, it could be of good use to send your log details. It is much easier to debug the problem this way.

_Settings_    
First make sure you have set the logging to notice level to make sure any is actually logged at the time of the problem.
Boxee Main Menu -> Settings -> Advanced -> Debug Level -> Notice

_Platform_    
For the boxee platforme versions (pc/mac/linux) you can just copy your log from you boxee userdata. You can find the correct directory for your installation here: Boxee support

_Boxee Box_    
For the boxee box you can not access the filesystem, so you have to get it from a special debug webpage. In your browser open the following link and replace "your boxee ip" with the ip address of your boxee box:    
"Your boxee ip":8080       
    
Press get latest, and download the latest archive found in the list.

You can just includes this with your mail, it will help out big time.
