## BartsideeTV Module Repository

In this folder you van find the modules used in the BartsideeTV application. The application fetches dynamically the index.json file, as such an application update is not needed to updated a specific module.

To add, remove or update a module dynamically from the app edit the **index.json** file. If the version number is updated the application will automatically re-download the python file.


The **modules** are located in the subfolders, they consist out of an image and a python file. Find more information about the architecture [here](https://github.com/bartsidee/bartsidee-boxee/wiki/BartsideeTv-Modules)
